Z.ai's GLM-4.5V sets a new standard in visual reasoning, achieving SOTA performance across 42 benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond benchmarks, it excels in real-world applications through hybrid training, enabling comprehensive visual understanding—from image/video analysis and GUI interaction to complex document processing and precise visual grounding. In China's GeoGuessr challenge, GLM-4.5V surpassed 99% of 21,000 human players within 16 hours, reaching 66th place in a week. Built on the GLM-4.5-Air foundation and inheriting GLM-4.1V-Thinking's approach, it leverages a 106B-parameter MoE architecture for scalable, efficient performance. This model bridges advanced AI research with practical deployment, delivering unmatched visual intelligence
